This option tells GPSBabel to assume that there was a valid GPS fix while
writing NMEA output. The default is to use the fix information from the
data which is being read. To force GPSBabel to set the fix status fields
in the NMEA to valid, specify <option>force_fix=1</option>

Unfortunately not all formats are able to save the GPS fix status,
so GPSBabel defaults to set the fix status field to V
(Navigation receiver warning) as the input file does not provide
any fix information. While this is the proper way to handle these
cases, the written NMEA sentences are sometimes ignored by programs
which read NMEA and accept location information only when the fix
was valid. So if you know that the converted information is
correct, using <option>force_fix=1</option> allows you to create
NMEA output which is usable for these programs.
