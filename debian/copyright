        This package is distributable under the terms of the Artistic
License. You should have received a file called "Artistic", which
specifies the terms under which this package may be distributed and
modified.
        The Artistic License is taken from the Perl 5.005_03
distribution, so some of the text is specific to Perl and does not
apply to ColdSync. I hope to address this in a future release.
