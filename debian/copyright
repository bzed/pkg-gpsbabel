 .
 Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional
 permissions described in the Autoconf Configure Script Exception,
 version 3.0, as published by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 The Autoconf Configure Script Exception version 3 is below:
 .
            AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION
            Version 3.0, 18 August 2009
 .
 This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU
 General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3").  It applies to a given
 file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file
 stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
 .
 The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's
 typical output under terms of the recipient's choice (including
 proprietary).
 .
 0. Definitions
 .
 "Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf
 that is a covered work under this License.
 .
 "Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of
 its Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not
 from its input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and
 non-tracing output.
 .
 "Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.
 .
 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
 .
 You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such
 propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3.  However, if
 by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you
 received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then
 you void this Exception for the resulting covered work.  If you convey
 that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance
 with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.
 .
 2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
 .
 The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
 that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of
 the license of Autoconf.
